\section{Conclusion}
We have seen that the metric for the BTZ Black Hole can be derived from the requirements that it is stationary and circularly symmetric, which is the same as saying it has two killing vectors $\partial_\phi$ and $\partial_t$. Because the spacetime is (2+1) dimensional, it has been shown that it must be locally maximally symmetric. Additionally, it has been shown that the BTZ spacetime can be constructed from the AdS$_3$ spacetime with the identification $\phi \sim \phi + 2 \, \pi$. Through an analysis of the metric and the conformal diagram for the spacetime, we see that the causal structure of the BTZ Black Hole is that of the Schwarzschild Black Hole near the horizon and the AdS$_3$ near infinity. Unlike in the Schwarzschild solution, the point at $r = 0$ has been shown to not possess a curvature singularity. Instead, it is of a more exotic form called a causal singularity for $M > 0$ and a conical singularity for $M < 0$.\\
Through finding thermal Green's Functions for a conformally coupled scalar field on the BTZ Black Hole background, we have shown that we can associate a temperature of $T = \frac{r_+}{2 \pi \ell^2}$ with the static BTZ Black Hole. This result calls for further research in the evaporation of a BTZ Black Hole.
