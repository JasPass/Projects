# In a 20x20 grid every path consists of 40 choices of either:
# GO RIGHT or GO DOWN. We have to GO RIGHT 20 times in total and
# we also have to GO DOWN 20 ties in total. Therefore, if we decide
# In which 20 out of the 40 cases we choose GO DOWN, the path is
# determined. Therefore the answer is 40 choose 20.

# Calculate 40 choose 20
